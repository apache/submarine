# Submarine Implementation Notes 

Before digging into details of implementations, you should read [architecture-and-requirements](./architecture-and-requirements.md) first to understand overall requirements and architecture.

Here're sub topics of Submarine implementations:

- [Submarine Storage](./storage-implementation.md): How to store metadata, logs, metrics, etc. of Submarine.
- [Submarine Environment](./environments-implementations.md): How environments created, managed, stored in Submarine. 
- [Submarine Experiment](./experiment-implementations.md): How experiments managed, stored, and how the predefined experiment template works.
